## About us and the apartment
We are: an alumnus from the FH-Wels (Automatisierungstechnik, AT), now employed in Linz, a Norwegian PhD Student at the JKU, and a normal guy from Ecuador, currently employed in Linz. We are looking for a fourth person to take a big room that has recently become free.

The apartment has a big balcony (facing south) where we sometimes grill in the summer. We have a big living room where we can sit, watch TV, talk, read. The kitchen is fully equipped with ceramic plates, dishwasher and normal appliances. We have a full bathroom with bathtub, 2 washbasins, a washing machine, and a WC. Additionally there is a second separate "guest WC". All rooms have parquet floor (wooden), except for the kitchen and the entrance (tiles). During the week we both work in Linz and on weekends we might have some friends over or go out to the city, so we have a healthy balance of fun and responsibilities.

### Safety deposit
Like pretty much every apartment you rent in Austria, there is a safety deposit (German Kaution) and your share amounts to 875&euro;

## Location
Goethestrasse 30, in Linz downtown, with very good public transport connections, close to the main train station. Many different supermarkets within walking distance.

## Public transport
- Bus 12 (bus stop directly in front of our door) takes you directly to the main train station in 5 mins(Linz Hbf).
- 4 min walking to the Tram station Goethekreuzung (one before Linz Hbf).

## About yourself
Preferably your have an international background, you are not very shy, and like some community/social life. You are tidy and clean after yourself. You feel comfortable in the company of new people.

## Available room
Really big 27m<sup>2</sup> 469,40 &euro;/month, windows facing north, two doors. At the moment it is separated by a wardrobe and bookshelves into a sleeping room and a studio (bookshelves, table, chair...). It will  be furnished (you can talk to the old guy if you want to bring your own stuff)

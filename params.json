We are looking for a fourth person to take a big room that has recently become free.\r\n\r\nThe apartment has a big balcony (facing south) where we sometimes grill in the summer. We have a big living room where we can sit, watch TV, talk, read. The kitchen is fully equipped with ceramic plates, dishwasher and normal appliances. We have a full bathroom with bathtub, 2 washbasins, a washing machine, and a WC. Additionally there is a second separate \"guest WC\". All rooms have parquet floor (wooden), except for the kitchen and the entrance (tiles). During the week we both work in Linz and on weekends we might have some friends over or go out to the city, so we have a healthy balance of fun and responsibilities.\r\n\r\n### Safety deposit\r\nLike pretty much every apartment you rent in Austria, there is a safety deposit (German Kaution) and your share amounts to 875&euro;\r\n\r\n## Location\r\nGoethestrasse 30, in Linz downtown, with very good public transport connections, close to the main train station. Many different supermarkets within walking distance.\r\n\r\n## Public transport\r\n- Bus 12 (bus stop directly in front of our door) takes you directly to the main train station in 5 mins(Linz Hbf).\r\n- 4 min walking to the Tram station Goethekreuzung (one before Linz Hbf).\r\n\r\n## About yourself\r\nPreferably your have an international background, you are not very shy, and like some community/social life.
